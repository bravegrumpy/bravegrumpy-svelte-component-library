# BraveGrumpy Website Svelte Component Library

## Overview

This component library translates the svelte components used in [my personal website](https://www.bravegrumpy.com) into explicitly responsive components. 

### Goals

- [ ] Have a typesafe component libray in svelte
- [ ] migrate my main webstie to this component library.
- [ ] include responsive web design.

## Notes 

This will ultimately be a slow process, as this is "boring".  However, I hope to be able to use this in other projects.

# BraveGrumpy Website Svelte Component Library

## Overview

This component library translates the svelte components used in [my personal website](https://www.bravegrumpy.com) into explicitly responsive components. 

### Goals

- [ ] Have a typesafe component libray in svelte
- [ ] migrate my main webstie to this component library.
- [x] include responsive web design.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

This is a `svelte` component library. The components are svelte components. 

This library uses tailwind, with a namespace. Therefore, it should not interfere with your tailwind config and classes in the rest of your project.

**Install**: `npm install bravegrumpy-svelte-component-library@latest`


## Notes 

This will ultimately be a slow process, as this is "boring".  However, I hope to be able to use this in other projects.
